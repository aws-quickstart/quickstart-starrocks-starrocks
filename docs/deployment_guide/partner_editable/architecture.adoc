image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans multiple Availability Zones.
* A VPC peering connection to connect a customer's VPC containing their client application to the Quick Start VPC.
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** A Linux bastion host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure Shell (SSH) access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in public and private subnets.
* In the private subnets, two services of StarRocks nodes deployed to Amazon EC2 instances.
** A frontend service for metadata management, client connections, and query scheduling. It contains follower nodes to perform read operations and leader nodes to modify metadata.
** A backend service containing backend nodes for data storage and SQL computing.
