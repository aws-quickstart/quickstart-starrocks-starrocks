.Quick Start architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Quick Start sets up the following:

* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** A Linux bastion host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure
Shell (SSH) access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in public and private subnets.

* In the private subnets: a StarRocks cluster is deployed. (To learn more about StarRocks' architecture, please refer to https://docs.starrocks.com/en-us/main/quick_start/Architecture[StarRocks Architecture])
** Front End service is responsible for metadata management, management of client connectors, query planning, query scheduling, etc.
*** FE leader nodes modifies metadata.
*** FE follower nodes performs read operations.
** Back End Service is responsible for data storage, calculation execution, compaction, replication management, etc.


// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Ensure that the additional components are shown in the architecture diagram. End each bullet with a period.
* Use VPC Peering to connect user's VPC to the VPC where this QuickStart is deployed.


[.small]#* The template that deploys this Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#
